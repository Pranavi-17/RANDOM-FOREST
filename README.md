# Project Title : Analysis and predicting the Iris species with the Random Forest.

# Tools & Technology:
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Python Programming Language
3. Google Colab

# Problem Statement:
### Random Forest is an ensemble technique capable of performing both regression and classification tasks with the use of multiple decision trees and a technique called Bootstrap and Aggregation, commonly known as bagging. The basic idea behind this is to combine multiple decision trees in determining the final output rather than relying on individual decision trees.
### Random Forest has multiple decision trees as base learning models. We randomly perform row sampling and feature sampling from the dataset forming sample datasets for every model. This part is called Bootstrap. We need to approach the Random Forest regression technique like any other machine learning technique.         

# Project Approch
1. *Load the Iris dataset*
2. *Split the dataset into training and testing sets*
3. *Create a Random Forest classifier with 100 trees*
4. *Train the classifier on the training data*
5. *Make predictions on the test data*
6. *Calculate accuracy*
